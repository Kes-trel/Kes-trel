# Data Enthusiast

Having worked for over a decade in the UKâ€™s water industry as a civil engineer I gained significant experience in a variety of interesting and challenging projects where problem solving was required.

Data has always played a key part in my decision making and when I chose to embark on a career change, I was drawn to data science.

I have been teaching myself programming and machine learning. I also recognise the invaluable benefits of on the job training and I am keen to connect and work with industry experts to develop both technical and professional skills.
